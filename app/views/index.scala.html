            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    The player may play one action cards. These are the Kingdom cards that say: "Action" at the bottom of the card.<br>
                    Players don't start with any Action cards, so during the first 1 turns no Actions can be performed.<br>
                    Normally a player can play only one card, but some action cards allow the player to play more cards.<br>
                    To play a card, the player lays the action card face-up in his play area. He announces which card he is playing and follows the instructions written on that card from top to bottom.<br>
                    The player may still play the Action card even when he is not able to do everything listed.<br>
                    Any action cards played remain in the player's play area until the Clean-up phase of the turn unless otherwise indicated on the card.<br>
                    The action phase ends when the player cannot or chooses not to play any more Action cards.<br>

            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    The player can gain one card from the Supply by paying its cost. The cost of a card is found in the lower left corner.<br>
                    Any card in the Supply maybe be bought, but the player may not purchase cards from the Trash Pile. When a player played a certain card in his Action phase, its possible that he is allowed to buy more than one card.<br>
                    The player places the purchased card from the Supply pile face-up on his Discard pile. The ability of the purchased card may not be used when he just gain the card.<br>
                    The treasure cards remain in the play area until the Clean-up phase. Treasure cards will be used multiple times during the game. Treasure cards are a source of income, not a resource that is used up when played.<br>
                    Coppers are worth 1 coin, Silvers are worth 2 coins and Golds are worth 3 coins.<br>

                    All cards gained are already in the player's discard pile. The player places also all his cards (played and unplayed) to this pile.<br>
                    The player now draws a new hand of 5 cards from his Deck. If there are not enough cards in his Deck, he draws as many as he can.<br>
                    The player shuffles then his Discard pile to form a new face-down Deck, and then draws the rest of his new hand.<br>
                    Once the player has drawn a new hand of 5 cards, the next player starts his turn.<br>
                    To speed up play, players may begin their turns while the previous players are completing their clean-up phases, but when someone plays an Attack card, the players must complete their Clean-up phases first in order to resolve the Attack.<br>

                    The game ends when the last Province is bought, or when 3-4 piles are empty. The players will count their victory points in their decks and the player with the most points wins.<br>
                    If there is a tie, then the player with the fewest turns wins.
